# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview

Kickstarter is the leading crowdfunding platform in the world. However, it's popularity creates a volatile and competitive environment for new campaigners. A data-driven approach to campaign launch decisions creates a competitive advantage and is strongly recommended.

## Objective 

This pupose of this project is to analyze historical Kickstar data to gain a better understanding of the crowdfunding process from start to finish on Kickstarter, identify trends in a target category, and find ideal conditions to mirror outcomes of sucessful Kickstarter campaigns. 

## Analysis and Results

Two apparent conclusions drawn from Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are the optimal month to launch a campaign and the worst month for plays. My analysis of the Kickstarter campaigns suggests that the ideal start date is in the month of May, with a target goal of less than 1000 to 4999. Please see the the visual representation of these findings are below.

## Limitations of Dataset  

This data set did not have enough information to draw any definitive conclusion on the viability of an international campaigns in the Theater/play category. I would suggest getting additional data on global Kickstarter campaigns before launching. 

## Future Visual Represenation  

With this dataset, it is possible to create a chart displaying the ideal number of campaign backers for a particular campaign category.
