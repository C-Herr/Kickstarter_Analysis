# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview

Kickstarter is the leading crowdfunding platform in the world. However, it's popularity creates a volatile and competitive environment for new campaigners. A data-driven approach to campaign launch decisions creates a competitive advantage and is strongly recommended.

## Objective 

This pupose of this project is to analyze historical Kickstar data to gain a better understanding of the crowdfunding process from start to finish on Kickstarter, identify trends in a target category, and find ideal conditions to mirror outcomes of sucessful Kickstarter campaigns. 

## Analysis 

My analysis of the Kickstarter campaigns aimed at theater/plays suggests that the ideal start date is in the month of May, with a goal between less than 1000 to 4999. The visual representation of these findings are below.

## Challenge

Our client wanted to launch a Kickstarter campaign internationally in Great Britain. This data set did not have enough information to draw any definitive conclusion on the viability of an international campaign. I would suggest getting additional data on global Kickstarter campaigns before launching.
